MyFirst Repo
This is my initiation into GitHub using it for how it was meant, rather than looking at other's repos for courses I'm taking, well I should correct that statement, because it's all a part of how it was meant to be used.  It's all good.
My name is Wendell Fry.
I've been programming since about 2000, when I wanted to start learning to program, and I started with VB6.  Ok, I have to go further back to about 1998, because I learned to write formulas in Excel from a guy who gave me an order form with a table of items off to the side, referenced in the orderform.  It used "=IF(ISBLANK A1, "", VLOOKUP(A1,$K$22:$0$38,3,FALSE))" 
From there I learned programming logic, and this IF statement is sort of a ternary operation, IF A="" ? "":1;
But the best way to learn programming is on the job and I had to work a lot of little jobs to survive, so I couln't focus on learning programming, though focusing on that earlier would have solved a lot of income issues sooner.
I went through a book on C# around 2003 or so, and started learning SQL in 2012, and worked a little more with C#, Sharepoint web editing, etc. in 2014.
I worked with MobileFrame for 5 months in 2015 (which contained a lot of string functions and SQL inside of steps used for variable/data assignment and manipulation with a SQL Server backend.
It went slowly on from there and I'm finally able to learn on the job with PHP, C#, javascript, HTML, bootstrap, Oracle SQL, VB.Net, etc. and now I'm taking a lot of courses on Udemy.  I'm determined to learn and become proficient in programming.
